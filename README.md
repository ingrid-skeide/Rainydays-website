# Rainydays
## cross course project

This is the first website project I have made. This site is used for learning. The site is a fictional, non-funcional webshop suitable for learning everything about front-end development, from design and planning, to fetching products from api and creating a functional cart.

## Description

The project contains the following pages:

- Home page with menu, header, favourites.
- About page
- Contact page with a simple form with form validation.
- Product pagess dynamically built using REST API.
- Product specific page for each product post built using query string parameter.

## What I learned

For the first draft of this website, the most important thing I learned is how to work with HTML and CSS simultaneoulsy and effectively. It was great practice and have made me good at working on development projects. For the second draft of this project, the most important thing I learned was how to revisit and rewrite code. It was really fun to see how far I have gotten.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Wordpress
